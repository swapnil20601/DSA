# Recursion:
> 1. Check if array is sorted : ***https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-check-array-sorted-not-iterative-recursive/***
> 2. Check if given tree is BST: ***https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/***

# Arrays:
> 1. https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/ 
    > ***You were able to do in O(N) space & that is acceptable. But try to do it in O(1) space using cyclic sort. By converting string to charArray & swaping the chars in the same charArray as well correctly swapping nums in indices[]. By that you will reduce no of swaps & you will do in in O(1) space. You wont need to create extra charArray and convert it to string later***
